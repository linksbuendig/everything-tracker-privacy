# Privacy Policy for Everything Tracker

---

[German version/ Deutsche Version](/privacy_policy_de.md)

**Last Updated:** July 30, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Everything Tracker ("we," "us," or "our") handles information collected from users of the Everything Tracker mobile application (the "App"). We're committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## 1. Your Data Stays on Your Phone

The main purpose of **Everything Tracker** is to help you track your personal data. **All personal data you put into Everything Tracker is stored only on your device.** This data **never** leaves your phone. We don't collect, store, transmit, or access any of the personal information you enter into the App, such as your.

## 2. Information We DO Collect (Non-Personal Data)

While your personal tracking data stays on your device, we do collect some non-personal information. We do this to improve the App's quality, understand how it's used, and support our services. This information is anonymous and won't directly identify you.

* **Crashlytics (Crash Reporting):** We use Google's Crashlytics to monitor and report app crashes. If the app crashes, Crashlytics sends us anonymous information about the crash, like the crash type, the app's state at the time of the crash, and device details (e.g., device model, OS version). This helps us find and fix bugs to make the app more stable. For more about Crashlytics' data handling, please see Google's privacy policy.

* **Firebase Analytics (Usage Analytics):** We use Google's Firebase Analytics to understand how users interact with our App. This service collects anonymous usage data, such as:
    * **App Usage Data:** Information about how you use the App, including features you access, screens you view, and how long you use it.
    * **Device Information:** General device information like device type, operating system, and unique device identifiers (which are anonymized for analytics).
    * **Performance Data:** Information related to how the App performs.

    This data helps us understand user behavior, improve the app's design, and decide which new features to build. This data is grouped together and anonymized, so it can't be used to identify you personally. For more about Firebase Analytics' data handling, please see Google's privacy policy.

* **AdMob (Advertising):** We use Google AdMob to show ads within the App. AdMob may collect and use certain information to provide personalized ads. This might include:
    * **Device Identifiers:** Like advertising IDs (e.g., Google Ad ID, IDFA), which you can reset through your device settings.
    * **Location Information:** Derived from your device settings (e.g., IP address) for general location-based targeting, if location services are enabled for the App.
    * **App Usage Information:** To guess your interests and show you more relevant ads.

    Please note that AdMob's data collection and use are covered by Google's Privacy Policy. You can often control personalized advertising through your device's settings. For more about AdMob's data handling, please see Google's privacy policy.

## 3. How We Use the Non-Personal Information We Collect

We use the non-personal information from Crashlytics, Firebase Analytics, and AdMob for these reasons:

* To understand how you use the App and make it better.
* To fix technical issues and bugs.
* To see trends and activity related to our App.
* To show you relevant ads within the App.
* To develop new features and services.

## 4. Data Retention

* **Personal Data (on your device):** Your personal tracking data stays on your device until you delete the App or specifically delete the data within the App.
* **Non-Personal Data (Crashlytics, Analytics, AdMob):** Anonymous data collected by Crashlytics, Firebase Analytics, and AdMob is kept by Google according to their own data retention policies. We don't store this data ourselves.

## 5. Data Security

While your personal data never leaves your device, we use reasonable security measures to protect the limited non-personal information we do collect from accidental loss, misuse, or unauthorized access. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage method is 100% secure.

## 6. Your Choices

* **Personal Data:** You have complete control over the personal data you enter into the App. You can change or delete this data anytime within the App.
* **Advertising Preferences:** You can usually control personalized advertising through your device settings. For Android, go to **Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization**. For iOS, go to **Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking > Allow Apps to Request to Track** (and disable for individual apps if you wish).
* **Analytics and Crash Reporting:** These services are vital for improving the App. While it's less common, you might be able to disable some data collection features through your device settings or if the App offers a specific opt-out.

## 7. Children's Privacy (COPPA - US)

Our App is not for children under 13. We don't knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and think your child has given us personal information, please contact us at [Your Support Email Address], and we'll remove it from our systems. Since personal data stays on the device, this mainly refers to any accidental collection through AdMob or general analytics.

## 8. Your Rights (GDPR - EU Users)

If you're in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK, you have certain rights regarding your personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While we don't collect your personal tracking data, these rights generally apply to any personal data processed by third-party services like AdMob where they act as data controllers. These rights include:

* **The right to be informed:** About what data is collected and how it's used.
* **The right of access:** To ask for copies of your personal data.
* **The right to rectification:** To ask us to correct any information you believe is inaccurate.
* **The right to erasure ("right to be forgotten"):** To ask us to erase your personal data, under certain conditions.
* **The right to restrict processing:** To ask us to limit how we process your personal data, under certain conditions.
* **The right to object to processing:** To object to our processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.
* **The right to data portability:** To ask us to transfer the data we've collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.
* **The right to withdraw consent:** If we rely on your consent to process your personal data.

Since we don't directly collect your personal tracking data, you manage your core data within the app directly on your device. For data collected by Google's services (AdMob, Analytics, Crashlytics), please refer to Google's privacy policy for how to exercise these rights regarding their processing.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We'll let you know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the App. We recommend reviewing this Privacy Policy regularly for any updates. Changes become effective when they're posted in the App.
